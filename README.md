At the beginning of the pandemic, I scraped & archived the COVID page for each state's Dept. of Health each day. 

I ended up discovering and reporting multiple issues with these pages, including that Nebraska's page was down for almost a full day, and, far worse, Georgia didn't even have a COVID-19 page until weeks later than other states. Another concerning finding is just how poor the data reporting is for most state sites. This has now been fairly widely reported on but I am still shocked at just how opaque most states are with their case data.
